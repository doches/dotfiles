    This is my castle
    There are others just like it
    But this one is mine
    
In other words, these are my beloved dotfiles, my darlings, my eternally edited and tirelessly tweaked 
configurations and customizations. They are dear to my heart, my preciousness -- and I **hate** working
on a machine without them.

Fortunately, there's [Homesick](http://github.com/technicalpickes/homesick), a tool for managing, porting,
and sharing dotfiles. Collections of dotfiles in Homesick are called Castles; this one is mine. Hence the haiku.

...and now you know.
